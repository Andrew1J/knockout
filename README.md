# Knockout

## Description
Knockout is a two-player game 

Players will  observe how varying physical variables including the masses of individual pucks, elasticity of the collisions, and the frictional force (by changing the material the field is made out of) alters the mechanics of the game.

### Physics Concepts Incorporated
- 2-Dimensional Collisions by Circular Objects of Varying Masses (elastic and inelastic)
- Frictional Force

## Instructions and Controls
To play this game, TODO

- Each player starts three pucks on one side of the field. 
- Player A decides in which direction and with what speed each of their pucks will travel by drawing an arrow emanating from each of their pucks. Player B does the same. 
- By clicking the Shoot button, the selected movements will simultaneously occur and pucks that collide will have their trajectory altered accordingly based on physical laws. 
- All pucks will eventually come to a stop due to friction. Pucks with an end position outside the field are eliminated and the state is reset for the next turn. 
- The Player who eliminates all of their opponentâ€™s pucks first wins.
- Players may reset the game by pressing 'r'.
